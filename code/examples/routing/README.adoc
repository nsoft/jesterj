This is not an example of a working project. It is used to create the graphics for the wiki page on fault tolerant indexing

Sadly it doesn't seem that GitHub can render dot directly. To recreate this graphic

. Install the intellij dot plugin
. Save the rendered image as a peer of this README file.
. Open the image in a browser
. Screenshot/crop the image to remove the enormous useless transparent spacing at the top and bottom

The image is referenced by the documentation so don't change the name of the file without updating the wiki in github.
