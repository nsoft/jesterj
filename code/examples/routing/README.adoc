This is not an example of a working project. It is used to create the graphics for the wiki page on fault tolerant indexing

To recreate this graphic install the intellij dot plugin, and save the rendered image as a peer of this README file.
The images are referenced by the documentation so don't change the name of the file without updating the wiki in github.
