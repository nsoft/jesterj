WARNING: Additionally JesterJ distributes an executable jar file which
bundles binaries for and has runtime dependency on the libraries listed below.
Each of these dependent libraries are distributed under the terms of THIER OWN
license (not JesterJ's license). JesterJ's executable jar should NOT be used
unless the license terms of all dependent libraries are acceptable. Included
dependent libraries often are copy written works and should be treated as such
unless YOU have gathered clear evidence to the contrary. In some cases, where
required by licenses listed below the copyright notices are reproduced in the
folder for the software, but the absence of such a notice DOES NOT IMPLY that
the work is not subject to copyright. You must consult the work itself (by
unpacking and examining it) or read the project documentation for the dependent
libarary available on the web or elsewhere to ensure you find the full set of
applicable copyright information.

JesterJ attempts to not distribute any libraries that only offer a license
listed as "Category X" by the Apache Software foundation here.

   https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#category-x

If such a license is found to be included in a distributed archive please
notify us at once so we can remove it. Note that in cases of Dual Licensing
the chosen license is listed below.

In this directory you will find a subdirectory for each license type in use.
Within each license type directory you will find a copy of the license and
a README.txt summarizing what the requirements for shipping a BINARY copy of
associated software is. Also in each license type subdirectory you will find
one or more artifact subdirectories representing each dependency that is used
under the license type represented by the containing directory. Artifact
directories contain a README.txt and any other required files (such as NOTICE.txt
for ASL 2.0). The README will explain how each requirement is met, and provide
urls at which related information can be verified.
