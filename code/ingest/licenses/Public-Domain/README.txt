The software represented in this directory has been released into the public domain. It therefore
is entirely distributed to you by JesterJ under the terms of a modified Apache Software License 2.0. This
license provides better protections for the JesterJ project than public domain, and public domain
allows us to do anything we like. Note that use of this license for the public domain software
does NOT constitute a claim of copyright on the public domain software, references to copyright
simply do not apply.

Specifically the ASL 2.0 for these works has been modified to include public domain works in the defintion of work.
The only important difference is the following subtraction and addition:

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      copyright notice or public domain attribution that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

Other trivial modifications include

* adjustment of the license name to avoid confusion
* adjustment of the date
* removal of the appendix example

If you are unsatisfied with the terms of this modified Apache Software License, and wish to use it under
other terms you must acquire these libraries from another source. The ASL 2.0 is replicated in this directory
for your convenience. The README.txt for each software library will attempt to identify such an alternate
source where possible.
