The above license applies to all new work done under the name "uno-jar" but MUCH of the code remains from
the original version of the software by Simon Tuffs. Please see the NOTICE.txt for additional terms for
the use of Simon's code.

NOTE: I had no desire to rename from One-JAR or change the package names, except Simon's license clearly states
that his name and the One-JAR trade mark may not be used to endorse derived software. All re-naming is out
of respect for the terms of his license. If I have missed a file, string constant or documentation and the
One-JAR trademark or simon's name are found anywhere other than this file, NOTICE.txt, license attribution comments
or comments referencing the history of when something was added, please file an issue
in the github bug tracker so it can be removed. Simon does not endorse uno-jar in any way and my only
interactions with him as of this writing can be seen in the source forge bug tracker.
