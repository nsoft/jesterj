This directory collects the required notification and documentation
required by the

Eclipse-2.0

software license. Sub directories must be named after the actual artifact
included in our node-jar distribution, and per this license each sub directory
should contain:

1. Reasonable means to obtain source code (will provide link in README.txt)
2. Copy of the Eclipse 2.0 license (provided in this directory)

JesterJ does not distribute source the code for CPL libraries. All other
Documentation Requirements in the CPL apply to distributed source code rather
than binary distributions.
