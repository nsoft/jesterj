This directory collects the required notification and documentation
required by the

Eclipse-2.0

software license. Subdirectories must be named after the actual artifact
included in our node-jar distribution, and per this license each subdirectory
should contain:

1. Reasonable means to obtain source code (will provide link in README.txt)
2. Copy of the Eclipse 2.0 license (provided in this directory)

JesterJ does not distribute source the code for EPL libraries. All other
Documentation Requirements in the EPL apply to distributed source code rather
than binary distributions.
